# Probably if we were doing this from scratch, Podist wouldn't treat

# more in the future.

# So, this is just a fairly minimal object to turn a config into a hash.
# There are also methods for writing config â€” Podist does not use these,
# but the tests do. Note that they lose comments.

=head1 NAME

Podist::Config - configuration handling for Podist

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $Cfg = Podist::Config->new;
 my $config = $Cfg->read_config(conf_dir => "$ENV{HOME}/.podist");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Contains functions for handling the Podist configuration file, including
generating the default (template) configuration. Also contains functions
for editing configuration, used by the Podist tests.

Podist configuration is based on L<Config::General>, with most of the
convenience features allowed.

Note that this class is, for historical reasons, not really very OO. It
contains basically no state (and no user modifiable state). It mainly
works by returning configuration hashrefs.

=head2 PUBLIC METHODS

=over

=item read_config()

Reads a Podist configuration file and returns a Podist configuration
hash. Default values will be returned for things not present in the
configuration file.

Arguments:

=over

=item I<conf_dir>

Required. Directory holding the Podist configuration file. This must
already exist (and will be coerced to a absolute path, just in case).
This is only used to compute some of the default values.

=item I<conf_file>

Required. Path of the configuration file. Must already exist.

=back

=item write_config()

Writes a Podist configuration file. Note that there is no way to include
comments with this method; ths method is intended only for the Podist
tests (which need it for testing to make sure various configuration
options work).

Arguments:

=over

=item I<conf_file>

File to write the configuration to. If it already exists, its
overwritten.

=item I<config>

Podist configuration hashref. Note one special requirement: the
TitleIgnoreRE regexp must be compiled with C<qr/WHATEVER/u>; this is the
default for any half-recent version of Perl, when running with a C<use
5.024> or similar in effect. Non-half-recent versions of Perl can't run
Podist anyway. 

=back

=item read_or_create_config()

Reads a Podist configuration from the given directory or, if it doesn't
exist, creates a new default one. The new one will have
C<$config->{notyetconfigured}> set to a true value, so you can test that
to see if the user has configured Podist.

The configuration file will be named F<podist.conf> inside the
configuration directory.

Arguments:

=over

=item I<conf_dir>

Directory to find or create the Podist configuration in.
