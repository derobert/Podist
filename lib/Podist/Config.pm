# Probably if we were doing this from scratch, Podist wouldn't treat
# config as just a giant hash. But it's hard to change, and also it'd
# require centralizaing and/or probing a lot of knowledge to e.g., find
# out what attributes each module needs; Storage and Processor
# essentially handle their own config, for example.
#
# So this is currently a class without much state. Might be refactored
# more in the future.
#
# So, this is just a fairly minimal object to turn a config into a hash.
# There are also methods for writing config â€” Podist does not use these,
# but the tests do. Note that they lose comments.
